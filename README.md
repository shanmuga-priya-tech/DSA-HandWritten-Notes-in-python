# DSA Notes in Python (Handwritten)

Welcome to the repository of my handwritten notes on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with a focus on Python implementations. These notes are intended to help anyone learning or revising core DSA concepts. All notes are uploaded in PDF format and cover both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

## üìò Current Available Notes:

### 1. [Linked List Basics](./LinkedList_Basics.pdf)
This PDF covers the fundamental concepts and operations of **Linked Lists**. The following topics are discussed:

- **Append**: Adding elements to the end of the list.
- **Prepend**: Adding elements to the beginning of the list.
- **Insert**: Inserting elements at a specific position.
- **Pop**: Removing the last element from the list.
- **Pop First**: Removing the first element from the list.
- **Remove**: Removing an element at a specific index.
- **Reverse**: Reversing the linked list.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Use

- Simply download the PDFs or view them directly in the browser.
- Use these notes as a reference or study guide when learning or revising DSA concepts.
- Each note covers theoretical explanations followed by Python code snippets to illustrate the implementation.

## üöÄ Upcoming Topics

This repository will be continuously updated with more handwritten notes covering various DSA topics, including:

- Stack
- Queue
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- And more!
